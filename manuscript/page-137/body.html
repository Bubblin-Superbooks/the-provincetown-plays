Be shut in—with different life—that can't creep on? (<em>after trying to put destroying hands upon it</em>) It's hard to—get past what we've done.

Doesn't that show it has brought life from the life it left?</p><p>CLAIRE: But timidly, rather—wistfully. A little homesick. If it is less sure this time, then it is going back to—Miss Lane. But if the pattern's clearer now, then it has made friends of life that waits. I'll know to-morrow.</p><p>ELIZABETH: You know, something tells me this is <em>wrong</em>.</p></div> </div>
