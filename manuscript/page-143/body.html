<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>There are no windows at back, and there is no door save an opening in the floor. The delicately distorted rail of a spiral staircase winds up from below. CLAIRE <em>is seen through the huge ominous window as if shut into the tower. She is lying on a seat at the back looking at a book of drawings. To do this she has left the door of her lantern a little open—and her own face is clearly seen.</em></p><p>A door is heard opening below; laughing voices, CLAIRE <em>listens, not pleased.</em></p><p>ADELAIDE: (<em>voice coming up</em>) Dear—dear, why do they make such twisting steps.</p><p>HARRY: Take your time, most up now. (HARRY_'s head appears, he looks back._) Making it all right?</p><p>ADELAIDE: I can't tell yet. (<em>laughingly</em>) No, I don't think so.</p><p>HARRY: (<em>reaching back a hand for her</em>) The last lap—is the bad lap. (ADELAIDE <em>is up, and occupied with getting her breath.</em>)</p></div> </div>
