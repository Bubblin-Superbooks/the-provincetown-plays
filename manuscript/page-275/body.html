He is not of the city from which Morton College rises, but of a more country community farther in-state</em>. FELIX FEJEVARY, <em>now nearing the age of his father in the first act, is an American of the more sophisticated typeâ€”prosperous, having the poise of success in affairs and place in society</em>.</p><p>SENATOR: And this was the boy who founded the place, eh? It was his idea?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Yes, and his hill. I was there the afternoon he told my father there must be a college here. I wasn't any older then than my boy is now.</p><p>(<em>As if himself surprised by this</em>.)</p><p>SENATOR: Well, he enlisted a good man when he let you in on it. I've been told the college wouldn't be what it is today but for you, Mr Fejevary.</p></div> </div>
