What has gone out should bring fragrance from what it has left. But no definite fragrance, no limiting enclosing thing. I call the fragrance I am trying to create Reminiscence. (<em>her hand on the pot of the wistful little flower she has just given pollen</em>) Reminiscent of the rose, the violet, arbutus—but a new thing—itself. Breath of Life may be lonely out in what hasn't been. Perhaps some day I can give it reminiscence.</p><p>DICK: I see, Claire.</p><p>CLAIRE: I wonder if you do.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">HARRY: Now, Claire, you're going to be gay to-day,</p></div> </div>
