I wonder what happened to it.</p><p>MRS HALE: I s'pose maybe the cat got it.</p><p>MRS PETERS: No, she didn't have a cat. She's got that feeling some people have about catsâ€”being afraid of them. My cat got in her room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out.</p><p>MRS HALE: My sister Bessie was like that. Queer, ain't it?</p><p>MRS PETERS: (<em>examining the cage</em>) Why, look at this door. It's broke. One hinge is pulled apart.</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>looking too</em>) Looks as if someone must have been rough with it.</p><p>MRS PETERS: Why, yes.</p><p>(<em>She brings the cage forward and puts it on the table</em>.)</p><p>MRS HALE: I wish if they're going to find any evidence they'd be about it. I don't like this place.</p></div> </div>
