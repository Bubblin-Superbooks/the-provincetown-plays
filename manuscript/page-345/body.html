You don't get people out of jail by stopping in and calling for them.</p><p>MADELINE: But you got me.</p><p>FEJEVARY: Because of years of influence. At that, it wasn't simple. Things of this nature are pretty serious nowadays. It was only your ignorance got you out.</p><p>MADELINE: I do seem ignorant. While you were fixing it up for me, why didn't you arrange for him too?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Because I am not in the business of getting foreign revolutionists out of jail.</p><p>MADELINE: But he didn't do as much as I did.</p><p>FEJEVARY: It isn't what he did.
