(<em>gayly turning it</em>) Well, now, as to the birthday. What do you suppose Sarah is doing this instant? Putting red frosting on white frosting, (<em>writing it with her finger</em>) Madeline. And what do you suppose Horace is doing? (<em>this a little reproachfully</em>) Running around buying twenty-one red candles. Twenty-two—one to grow on. Big birthday cake. Party to-night.</p><p>MADELINE: But, auntie, I don't see how I can be there.</p><p>AUNT ISABEL: Listen, dear. Now, we've got to use our wits and all pull together. Of course we'd do anything in the world rather than see you—left to outsiders. I've never seen your uncle as worried, and—truly, Madeline, as sad. Oh, my dear, it's these human things that count! What would life be without the love we have for each other?</p></div> </div>
