<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">east, did you ever see anything more beautiful than that hill?</p><p>FELIX: It's like sculpture.</p><p>SILAS: Hm. (<em>the wistfulness with which he speaks of that outside his knowledge</em>) I s'pose 'tis. It's the way it rises—somehow—as if it knew it rose from wide and fertile lands. I climbed the hill that night, (<em>to</em> FEJEVARY) You'd been talkin'. As we waited between medicines you told me about your life as a young man. All you'd lived through seemed to—open up to you that night—way things do at times. Guess it was 'cause you thought you was goin' to lose your horse. See, that was Colonel, the sorrel, wasn't it?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Yes. Good old Colonel.</p><p>SILAS: You'd had a long run o' off luck. Hadn't got things back in shape since the war. But say, you didn't lose him, did you?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Thanks to you.</p></div> </div>
