I don't know as she was nervous. I sometimes sew awful queer when I'm just tired. (MRS HALE <em>starts to say something, looks at</em> MRS PETERS, <em>then goes on sewing</em>) Well I must get these things wrapped up. They may be through sooner than we think, (<em>putting apron and other things together</em>) I wonder where I can find a piece of paper, and string.</p><p>MRS HALE: In that cupboard, maybe.</p><p>MRS PETERS: (<em>looking in cupboard</em>) Why, here's a bird-cage, (<em>holds it up</em>) Did she have a bird, Mrs Hale?</p><p>MRS HALE: Why, I don't know whether she did or not—I've not been here for so long. There was a man around last year selling canaries cheap, but I don't know as she took one; maybe she did. She used to sing real pretty herself.</p></div> </div>
