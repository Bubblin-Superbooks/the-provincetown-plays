Let it live or let it die. It is our chance—our chance to bear—what's there. My dear one—I will love you so. With all of me. I am not afraid now—of—all of me. Be generous. Be unafraid.

All that we're open to—(_hesitates, shudders</em>) But yes—I will, I will risk the life that waits. Perhaps only he who gives his loneliness—shall find. You never keep by holding, (<em>gesture of giving</em>) To the uttermost. And it is gone—or it is there. You do not know and—that makes the moment—(<em>music has begun—a phonograph downstairs; they do not heed it</em>) Just as I would cut my wrists—(<em>holding them out</em>) Yes, perhaps this lesser thing will tell it—would cut my wrists and let the blood flow out till all is gone if my last drop would make—would make—(<em>looking at them fascinated</em>) I want to see it doing that!</p></div> </div>
