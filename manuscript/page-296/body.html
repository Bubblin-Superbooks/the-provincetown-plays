I heard old Mac hold him up for it—and what'd you think he said? That he'd been <em>ploughing</em>. Said he was trying to run a farm and go to college at the same time! Isn't it a <em>scream</em>?</p><p>HORACE: We oughta—make it more unpleasant for some of those jays. Gives the school a bad name.</p><p>FUSSIE: But, listen, Horace, honest—you'll just <em>die</em>. He said he was going to get the book this afternoon. Now you know what he <em>looks</em> like, but he turns to—(<em>both girls are convulsed</em>)</p><p>DORIS: It'll get him all fussed up!
