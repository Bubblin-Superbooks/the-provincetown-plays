(<em>looking into it</em>) I never saw anything like that before! There seems something alive—inside this outer shell.</p><p>DICK: (<em>he too looking in and he has an artist's manner of a hand up to make the light right</em>) It's quite new in form. It—says something about form.</p><p>HARRY: (<em>cordially to</em> CLAIRE, <em>who stands apart</em>) So you've really put it over. Well, well,—congratulations. It's a good deal of novelty, I should say, and I've no doubt you'll have a considerable success with it—people always like something new. I'm mighty glad—after all your work, and I hope it will—set you up.</p><p>CLAIRE: (<em>low—and like a machine</em>) Will you all—go away?</p></div> </div>
