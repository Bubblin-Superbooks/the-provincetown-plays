I—(<em>rather bashfully</em>) I love the Hill. I was thinking about it in jail. I got fuddled on direction in there, so I asked the woman who hung around which way was College Hill. 'Right through there', she said. A blank wall. I sat and looked through that wall—long time. (<em>she looks front, again looking through that blank wall</em>) It was all—kind of funny. Then later she came and told me you were out there, and I thought it was corking of you to come and tell them they couldn't put that over on College Hill. And I know Bakhshish will appreciate it too. I wonder where he went?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Went? I fancy he won't go much of anywhere to-night.</p><p>MADELINE: What do you mean?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Why, he's held for this hearing, of course.</p></div> </div>
