Certainly I do love Claire.</p><p>HARRY: Well, you're a cool one!</p><p>TOM: Let her be herself. Can't you see she's troubled?</p><p>HARRY: Well, what is there to trouble Claire? Now I ask you. It seems to me she has everything.</p><p>TOM: She's left so—open. Too exposed, (<em>as</em> HARRY <em>moves impatiently</em>) Please don't be annoyed with me. I'm doing my best at saying it. You see Claire isn't hardened into one of those forms she talks about. She's too—aware. Always pulled toward what could be—tormented by the lost adventure.</p><p>HARRY: Well, there's danger in all that. Of course there's danger.</p><p>TOM: But you can't help that.</p><p>HARRY: Claire was the best fun a woman could be. Is yet—at times.</p></div> </div>
