<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Johnson! That's not—what your mother died for.</p><p>MADELINE: Father, you must talk to me. What did my mother die for? No one has ever told me about her—except that she was beautiful—not like other people here. I got a feeling of—something from far away. Something from long ago. Rare. Why can't Uncle Felix talk about her? Why can't you? Wouldn't she want me to know her? Tell me about her. It's my birthday and I need my mother.</p><p>IRA: (<em>as if afraid he is going to do it</em>) How can you touch—what you've not touched in nineteen years? Just once—in nineteen years—and that did no good.</p><p>MADELINE: Try. Even though it hurts. Didn't you use to talk to her? Well, I'm her daughter. Talk to me. What has she to do with Emil Johnson?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">IRA: (<em>the pent-up thing loosed</em>) What has she to do with him? She died so he could live. He lives because she's dead, (<em>in anguish</em>) And what is <em>he</em> alongside her? Yes.</p></div> </div>
