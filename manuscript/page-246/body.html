You see, I never went to school—</p><p>GRANDMOTHER: I don't know why you say that, Silas. There was two winters you went to school.</p><p>SILAS: Yes, mother, and I'm glad I did, for I learned to read there, and liked the geography globe. It made the earth so nice to think about. And one day the teacher told us all about the stars, and I had that to think of when I was driving at night. The other boys didn't believe it was so. But I knew it was so! But I mean school—the way Mr Fejevary went to school. He went to universities. In his own countries—in other countries. All the things men have found out, the wisest and finest things men have thought since first they began to think—all that was put before them.</p><p>FEJEVARY: (<em>with a gentle smile</em>) I fear I left a good deal of it untouched.</p></div> </div>
