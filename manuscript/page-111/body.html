<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Elizabeth. A daughter is being delivered unto me this morning. I have a feeling it will be more painful than the original delivery. She has been, as they quaintly say, educated; prepared for her place in life.</p><p>HARRY: And fortunately Claire has a sister who is willing to give her young niece that place.</p><p>CLAIRE: The idea of giving anyone a place in life.</p><p>HARRY: Yes! The very idea!</p><p>CLAIRE: Yes! (<em>as often, the mocking thing gives true expression to what lies sombrely in her</em>) The war. There was another gorgeous chance.</p><p>HARRY: Chance for what? I call you, Claire. I ask you to say what you mean.</p><p>CLAIRE: I don't know—precisely. If I did—there'd be no use saying it. (<em>at</em> HARRY's <em>impatient exclamation she turns to</em> TOM)</p><p>TOM: (<em>nodding</em>) The only thing left worth saying is the thing we can't say.</p></div> </div>
