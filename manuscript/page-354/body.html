These things are not child's play—not today. You could get twenty years in prison for things you'll say if you rush out there now. (<em>she laughs</em>) You laugh because you're ignorant. Do you know that in America today there are women in our prisons for saying no more than you've said here to me!</p><p>MADELINE: Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself!</p></div> </div>
