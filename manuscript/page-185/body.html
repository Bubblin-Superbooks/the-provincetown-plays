<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">matter, (<em>to the doctor</em>) I think it is very kind of you—helping people go insane. I suppose they have all sorts of reasons for having to do it—reasons why they can't stay sane any longer. But tell me, how do they do it? It's not so easy to—get out. How do so many manage it?</p><p>EMMONS: I'd like immensely to have a talk with you about all this some day.</p><p>ADELAIDE: Certainly this is not the time, Claire.</p><p>CLAIRE: The time?

There's something—not quite sound about making one thing into another thing. What we need is unity. (<em>from</em> CLAIRE <em>something like a moan</em>) Yes, dear, we do need it. (<em>to the doctor</em>) I can't say that I believe in making life over like this. I don't think the new species are worth it. At least I don't believe in it</p></div> </div>
