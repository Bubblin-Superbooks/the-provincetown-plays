  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \"><em>the outer door opens and the</em> SHERIFF <em>comes in followed by the</em> COUNTY ATTORNEY <em>and</em> HALE. <em>The</em> SHERIFF <em>and</em> HALE <em>are men in middle life, the</em> COUNTY ATTORNEY <em>is a young man; all are much bundled up and go at once to the stove. They are followed by the two women—the</em> SHERIFF_'s wife first; she is a slight wiry woman, a thin nervous face_. MRS HALE <em>is larger and would ordinarily be called more comfortable looking, but she is disturbed now and looks fearfully about as she enters. The women have come in slowly, and stand close together near the door</em>.</p><hr class=\"section\"><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: (<em>rubbing his hands</em>) This feels good. Come up to the fire, ladies.</p><p>MRS PETERS: (<em>after taking a step forward</em>) I'm not—cold.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">SHERIFF: (<em>unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away</em></p>",

Are things just as you left them yesterday?</p><p>SHERIFF: (<em>looking about</em>) It's just the same. When it dropped below zero last night I thought I'd better send Frank out this morning to make a fire for us—no use getting pneumonia with a big case on, but I told him not to touch anything except the stove—and you know Frank.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Somebody should have been left here yesterday.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">SHERIFF: Oh—yesterday. When I had to send Frank to Morris Center for that man who went crazy—I want you to know I had my hands full yesterday. I knew you could get back from Omaha by today and as long as I</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">went over everything here myself—</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Well, Mr Hale, tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning.</p><p>HALE: Harry and I had started to town with a load of potatoes. We came along the road from my place and as I got here I said, I'm going to see if I can't get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone.' I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all he asked was peace and quiet—I guess you know about how much he talked himself; but I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before his wife, though I said to Harry that I didn't know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John—</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Let's talk about that later, Mr Hale. I do want to talk about that, but tell now just what happened when you got to the house.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">HALE: I didn't hear or see anything; I knocked at the</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">door, and still it was all quiet inside. I knew they must be up, it was past eight o'clock. So I knocked again, and I thought I heard somebody say, 'Come in.' I wasn't sure, I'm not sure yet, but I opened the door—this door (<em>indicating the door by which the two women are still standing</em>) and there in that rocker—(<em>pointing to it</em>) sat Mrs Wright.</p><p>(<em>They all look at the rocker</em>.)</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: What—was she doing?</p><p>HALE: She was rockin' back and forth. She had her apron in her hand and was kind of—pleating it.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: And how did she—look?</p><p>HALE: Well, she looked queer.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: How do you mean—queer?</p><p>HALE: Well, as if she didn't know what she was going to do next. And kind of done up.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: How did she seem to feel about your coming?</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">HALE: Why, I don't think she minded—one way or other. She didn't pay much attention. I said, 'How do, Mrs Wright it's cold, ain't it?' And she said, 'Is it?'—and went on kind of pleating at her apron. Well, I was surprised; she didn't ask me to come up to the stove, or to set down, but just sat there, not even looking at me, so I said, 'I want to see John.' And then she—laughed. I guess you would call it a laugh. I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said a little sharp: 'Can't I see John?' 'No', she says, kind o' dull like. 'Ain't he home?' says I. 'Yes', says she, 'he's home'. 'Then why can't I see him?' I asked her, out of patience. ''Cause he's dead', says she. <em>'Dead</em>?' says I. She just nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin' back and forth. 'Why—where is he?' says I, not knowing what to say. She just pointed upstairs—like that (<em>himself pointing to the room above</em>) I got up, with the idea of going up there. I walked from there to here—then I says, 'Why, what did</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he die of?' 'He died of a rope round his neck', says she, and just went on pleatin' at her apron. Well, I went out and called Harry. I thought I might—need help. We went upstairs and there he was lyin'—</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: I think I'd rather have you go into that upstairs, where you can point it all out. Just go on now with the rest of the story.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">HALE: Well, my first thought was to get that rope off. It looked ... (<em>stops, his face twitches</em>) ... but Harry, he went up to him, and he said, 'No, he's dead all right, and we'd better not touch anything.' So we went back down stairs. She was still sitting that same way. 'Has anybody been notified?' I asked. 'No', says she unconcerned. 'Who did this, Mrs Wright?' said Harry. He said it business-like—and she stopped pleatin' of her apron. 'I don't know', she says. 'You don't <em>know</em>?' says Harry. 'No', says she. 'Weren't you sleepin' in the bed with him?' says Harry. 'Yes', says she, 'but I was on the</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">inside'. 'Somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you didn't wake up?' says Harry. 'I didn't wake up', she said after him. We must 'a looked as if we didn't see how that could be, for after a minute she said, 'I sleep sound'. Harry was going to ask her more questions but I said maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner, or the sheriff, so Harry went fast as he could to Rivers' place, where there's a telephone.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: And what did Mrs Wright do when she knew that you had gone for the coroner?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">HALE: She moved from that chair to this one over here (<em>pointing to a small chair in the corner</em>) and just sat there with her hands held together and looking down. I got a feeling that I ought to make some conversation, so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put in a telephone, and at that she started to laugh, and then she stopped and looked at me—scared, (<em>the</em> COUNTY</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ATTORNEY, <em>who has had his notebook out, makes a note</em>) I dunno, maybe it wasn't scared. I wouldn't like to say it was. Soon Harry got back, and then Dr Lloyd came, and you, Mr Peters, and so I guess that's all I know that you don't.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: (<em>looking around</em>) I guess we'll go upstairs first—and then out to the barn and around there, (<em>to the</em> SHERIFF) You're convinced that there was nothing important here—nothing that would point to any motive.</p><p>SHERIFF: Nothing here but kitchen things.</p><p>(<em>The</em> COUNTY ATTORNEY, <em>after again looking around the kitchen, opens the door of a cupboard closet. He gets up on a chair and looks on a shelf. Pulls his hand away, sticky</em>.)</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Here's a nice mess.</p><p>(<em>The women draw nearer</em>.)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MRS PETERS: (<em>to the other woman</em>) Oh, her fruit; it</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">did freeze, (<em>to the</em> LAWYER) She worried about that when it turned so cold. She said the fire'd go out and her jars would break.</p><p>SHERIFF: Well, can you beat the women! Held for murder and worryin' about her preserves.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: I guess before we're through she may have something more serious than preserves to worry about.</p><p>HALE: Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.</p><p>(<em>The two women move a little closer together</em>.)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">COUNTY ATTORNEY: (<em>with the gallantry of a young politician</em>) And yet, for all their worries, what would we do without the ladies? (<em>the women do not unbend. He goes to the sink, takes a dipperful of water from the pail and pouring it into a basin, washes his hands. Starts to wipe them on the roller-towel, turns it for a cleaner place</em>) Dirty towels! (<em>kicks his foot against the pans under the sink</em>) Not much of a housekeeper, would you say,</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ladies?</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>stiffly</em>) There's a great deal of work to be done on a farm.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: To be sure. And yet (<em>with a little bow to her</em>) I know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which do not have such roller towels. (<em>He gives it a pull to expose its length again</em>.)</p><p>MRS HALE: Those towels get dirty awful quick. Men's hands aren't always as clean as they might be.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Ah, loyal to your sex, I see. But you and Mrs Wright were neighbors. I suppose you were friends, too.</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>shaking her head</em>) I've not seen much of her of late years. I've not been in this house—it's more than a year.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: And why was that? You didn't like her?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MRS HALE: I liked her all well enough. Farmers' wives</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">have their hands full, Mr Henderson. And then—</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Yes—?</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>looking about</em>) It never seemed a very cheerful place.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: No—it's not cheerful. I shouldn't say she had the homemaking instinct.</p><p>MRS HALE: Well, I don't know as Wright had, either.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: You mean that they didn't get on very well?</p><p>MRS HALE: No, I don't mean anything. But I don't think a place'd be any cheerfuller for John Wright's being in it.</p><p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: I'd like to talk more of that a little later. I want to get the lay of things upstairs now. (<em>He goes to the left, where three steps lead to a stair door</em>.)</p><p>SHERIFF: I suppose anything Mrs Peters does'll be all right. She was to take in some clothes for her, you know, and a few little things. We left in such a hurry yesterday.</p>",
  "page-21": "<p>COUNTY ATTORNEY: Yes, but I would like to see what you take, Mrs Peters, and keep an eye out for anything that might be of use to us.</p><p>MRS PETERS: Yes, Mr Henderson.</p><p>(<em>The women listen to the men's steps on the stairs, then look about the kitchen</em>.)</p><p>MRS HALE: I'd hate to have men coming into my kitchen, snooping around and criticising.</p><p>(<em>She arranges the pans under sink which the</em> LAWYER <em>had shoved out of place</em>.)</p><p>MRS PETERS: Of course it's no more than their duty.</p><p>MRS HALE: Duty's all right, but I guess that deputy sheriff that came out to make the fire might have got a little of this on. (<em>gives the roller towel a pull</em>) Wish I'd thought of that sooner. Seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MRS PETERS: (<em>who has gone to a small table in the left</em></p>",

(<em>Stands still</em>.)</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>eyes fixed on a loaf of bread beside the bread-box, which is on a low shelf at the other side of the room.

I wonder if it's all gone. (<em>gets up on the chair and looks</em>) I think there's some here that's all right, Mrs Peters. Yes—here; (<em>holding it toward the window</em>) this is cherries, too. (<em>looking again</em>) I declare I believe that's the only one. (<em>gets down, bottle in her hand.

She used to wear pretty</p>",

This all you was to take in?</p><p>MRS PETERS: She said she wanted an apron. Funny thing to want, for there isn't much to get you dirty in jail, goodness knows. But I suppose just to make her feel more natural. She said they was in the top drawer in this cupboard. Yes, here. And then her little shawl that always hung behind the door. (<em>opens stair door and looks</em>) Yes, here it is.</p><p>(<em>Quickly shuts door leading upstairs.</em>)</p><p>MRS HALE: (<em>abruptly moving toward her</em>) Mrs Peters?</p><p>MRS PETERS: Yes, Mrs Hale?</p><p>MRS HALE: Do you think she did it?</p><p>MRS PETERS: (<em>in a frightened voice</em>) Oh, I don't know.</p><p>MRS HALE: Well, I don't think she did.

  "page-25": "<p>MRS PETERS: (<em>starts to speak, glances up, where footsteps are heard in the room above. In a low voice</em>) Mr Peters says it looks bad for her. Mr Henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and he'll make fun of her sayin' she didn't wake up.</p><p>MRS HALE: Well, I guess John Wright didn't wake when they was slipping that rope under his neck.</p><p>MRS PETERS: No, it's strange. It must have been done awful crafty and still. They say it was such a—funny way to kill a man, rigging it all up like that.</p><p>MRS HALE: That's just what Mr Hale said. There was a gun in the house. He says that's what he can't understand.</p><p>MRS PETERS: Mr Henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive; something to show anger, or—sudden feeling.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MRS HALE: (<em>who is standing by the table</em>) Well, I don't see any signs of anger around here, (<em>she puts her hand on</em></p>",

(<em>threading a needle</em>) Bad sewing always made me fidgety.</p><p>MRS PETERS: (nervously) I don't think we ought to touch things.</p><p>MRS HALE: I'll just finish up this end.

  "page-29": "<p>MRS PETERS: Yes, Mrs Hale?</p><p>MRS HALE: What do you suppose she was so nervous about?</p><p>MRS PETERS: Oh—I don't know. I don't know as she was nervous.

There was a man around last year selling canaries cheap, but I don't know as she took one; maybe she did. She used to sing real pretty herself.</p>",
  "page-30": "<p>MRS PETERS: (<em>glancing around</em>) Seems funny to think of a bird here. But she must have had one, or why would she have a cage? I wonder what happened to it.</p><p>MRS HALE: I s'pose maybe the cat got it.</p><p>MRS PETERS: No, she didn't have a cat. She's got that feeling some people have about cats—being afraid of them. My cat got in her room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out.</p><p>MRS HALE: My sister Bessie was like that. Queer, ain't it?</p><p>MRS PETERS: (<em>examining the cage</em>) Why, look at this door. It's broke.

They say he was a good man.</p><p>MRS HALE: Yes—good; he didn't drink, and kept his word as well as most, I guess, and paid his debts. But he was a hard man, Mrs Peters.

This window opens out, but does not extend to the floor; only a part of its height is seen, indicating a very high window. Outside is seen the top of a tree.

He is not of the city from which Morton College rises, but of a more country community farther in-state</em>. FELIX FEJEVARY, <em>now nearing the age of his father in the first act, is an American of the more sophisticated type—prosperous, having the poise of success in affairs and place in society</em>.</p><p>SENATOR: And this was the boy who founded the place, eh? It was his idea?</p><p>FEJEVARY: Yes, and his hill. I was there the afternoon he told my father there must be a college here. I wasn't any older then than my boy is now.</p><p>(<em>As if himself surprised by this</em>.)</p><p>SENATOR: Well, he enlisted a good man when he let you in on it. I've been told the college wouldn't be what it is today but for you, Mr Fejevary.</p>",

You know, I presume, that they went in as strike-breakers during the trouble down here at the steel works. The plant would have had to close but for Morton College. That's one reason I venture to propose this thing of a state appropriation for enlargement. Why don't we sit down a moment? There's no conflict with the state</p>",

Excuse me, but why do you keep this man Holden?</p><p>FEJEVARY: In the scholar's world we're known because of him. And really, Holden's not a radical—in the worst sense. What he doesn't see is—expediency. Not enough the man of affairs to realize that we can't always have literally what we have theoretically. He's an idealist.

Oh, Madeline, of course. He has a daughter here in the college—Madeline Morton, senior this year—one of our best students. I'd like to have you meet Madeline—she's a great girl, though—peculiar.</p><p>SENATOR: Well, that makes a girl interesting, if she isn't peculiar the wrong way.
